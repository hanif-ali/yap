It builds on previous iterations with improvements in world knowledge, contextual coherence, and the ability to follow user intent more effectively.\n\nThe model demonstrates enhanced performance in tasks that require open-ended thinking, problem-solving, and communication. Early testing suggests it is better at generating nuanced responses, maintaining long-context coherence, and reducing hallucinations compared to earlier versions.\n\nThis research preview is intended to help evaluate GPT-4.5\u2019s strengths and limitations in real-world use cases as OpenAI continues to refine and develop future models.
